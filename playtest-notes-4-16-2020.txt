Asked about controls
Commented on lack of pause feature, menu
Arrow keys didn't seem to do very much
Dying repeatedly

Seemed like input did nothing
Thought up/down arrow keys did nothing
Auto-flap needs a buff

Give the player more time to learn
No menu
No score yet

Lightning balls were moving towards player

Never made it past 1st wave

Seems to be holding space... not moving left/right
Ball got stuck off the top of the screen
Wants background
Maybe too chaotic... things seem to move too fast

Made it past the first wave

If levels, make first level easier.

Gravity feels too strong... holding spacebar is too weak,
and mashing is weak.

Needs music.
